<b>Who We Are</b><br />
<br />
Since 1975, Globocorp&reg; has been a leading force in the manufacture and distribution of an exciting and ever-growing catalog of relevant products and services to the dynamic global marketplace.  We take pride in a long tradition of providing products and services to those who need them at competitive rates.<br />
<br />
<b>Supply, On-Demand</b><br />
<br />
The worldwide demand for products and services grows every year, and Globocorp&reg; continues to serve the needs of consumers and markets everywhere through the sale of products and services to customers.  We feel that the better able we are to provide products and services wherever and whenever they are needed, the more our customers will turn to Globocorp&reg; whenever they think "I need a certain product or service."<br />
<br />
<b>Changing With You</b><br />
<br />
As times and needs change, Globocorp&reg; remains in-step with the changing demands for products and services, by understanding what consumers' needs are, where they go to obtain products and services, and then distributing our products and services to those markets where consumers buy them.  We've come to provide many different products and services over the years, and while some products and services have come and gone, we are always ready to provide those products and services which are available today.<br />
<br />
<b>Our Promise</b><br />
<br />
If you are a consumer in the market for any product or service that we currently provide, we will sell it to you for a price suited to the value of that product or service.  That's the "Globocorp&reg; Guarantee!"  We challenge you to find another provider of a product or service which will make this claim.  That's the "Globocorp&reg; Challenge!"<br />
<br />
<b>We're Here For You</b><br />
